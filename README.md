Here's a concise, visual overview of Python basics:

Variables & Data Types

Strings  |  name = "John"
Numbers  |  age = 25
Lists    |  fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
Dictionaries | person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}

Operators

Arithmetic  |  a + b
Comparison |  a == b
Logical    |  a and b
Assignment |  a = b

Input/Output Statements:

1. input() - reads user input
2. print() - outputs data to the console
   
Control Structures:

1. if statement - conditional execution
2. elif statement - additional conditional checks
3. else statement - default action when conditions are false
4. for loop - iterates over sequences (lists, tuples, strings)
5. while loop - repeats execution while a condition is true

Function Definition:

1. def statement - defines a reusable function

Other control structures in Python include:

1. try-except block - error handling
2. with statement - context manager for resources (e.g., files)
3. break statement - exits loops prematurely
4. continue statement - skips to the next iteration
5. return statement - exits functions and returns values

Modules & Imports

Import  |  import math
Use     |  math.pi

To learn more:

- Use the built-in help() function: help(function_name) or help(module_name)
- Official Python Documentation: (https://www.python.org)
- Online Resources: W3Schools, Real Python, (Google them)

Happy coding!
